First, "Semantic Parsing" is, ironically, a semantically ambiguous term.
<!--more-->
In general, semantic parsing is the process of mapping a natural-language sentence into a formal representation of its meaning. A shallow form of semantic parsing is a case-role analysis (a.k.a. a sentence role labeling), which identifies roles such as agent, patient, source, and destination. A deeper semantic analysis provides a representation of the sentence in predicate logic or other formal language which supports automated reasoning.
